# Mixin Virtual Machine

Based on the Mixin Trusted Group technology, it's possible to make a huge MTG network that allows developers to deploy smart contracts without building their own groups. This network can be run by many nodes with some kind of PoS consensus rules, thus it could provide better reputation than every small trusted group.

The network doesn't run any smart contract virtual machines, instead it needs to work with existing networks, e.g. Ethereum, EOS or Solana. Let's assume the smart contract network is Ethereum, the idea is pretty straightforward.

1. The group receives a transaction from some Mixin Messenger users.
2. The group should invoke the group contract on Ethereum, all according to some registered rules in the transaction extra field.
3. Then the group contract could parse the message and store the Mixin transaction details in its storage.
4. Now any developer contracts can be notified that something has happened in the group contract, and they query it for recent transactions related to themselves.
6. In any case that some developer contract needs to send some message or money to some Mixin Messenger users, it should invoke the group contract with a message.
7. The group monitor all calls on the group contract and decide whether to send something to some Mixin Messenger users.

## Message

Mixin user to group memo.

Mixin group to contract extra.

Group contract data.

Developer contract to group contract extra.

## Performance

Multiple groups, multiple group contracts, multiple smart contract networks.

## Security

The group contract is mainly served as a message queue to developer contracts, anyone can send message to this contract without any special permissions, but my guarantee the correct message format. However the developer contracts should always validate the message signature, it should be signed by enough MTG group members. Threshold BLS signatures aggregated verification could be a possible solution to this purpose.

The BLS setup can just use the TIP code to do a initial setup.

Developer contracts balance check to ensure they can only do transfer out without exceeding the balance.

To prevent MEV, i.e. the extraction of value from Ethereum users by reordering, inserting, and censoring transactions within blocks. MTG should send the transaction with a monotically increasing nonce inside. When the developer contracts receive new notifications, they should ensure all the messages are in strictly correct order, if there is a gap, they should abort execution and wait until valid transactions come.

## Interoperability

The developer contract can wrap or map the MTG asset to its own native issued assets, just like the Curve cTokens, AAVE aTokens, WBTC or WETH. Then those assets can be used among with native raw smart contracts.

## Privacy

Masked user id for different contracts.

## Audits
